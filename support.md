# Bulk Texter Lite - Support

## General Tips
* To stop Bulk Texter Lite at any time, simply refresh the Google Voice tab.
* If you are unable to send a message manually (without Bulk Texter Lite), then that is an issue with your Google Voice account or the number you're sending to, and is not an issue that Bulk Texter Lite can help with. If Bulk Texter Lite isn't working, try sending a message manually and see if that works.
* Before proceeding with this guide, make sure that you are running the latest version of Bulk Texter Lite by following the [update guide](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/blob/main/README.md#update-it).
* Although text messages can be in any language, Bulk Texter Lite requires that the Google Voice interface be in English - make sure that both your Google Account and your browser settings are set to English for the Google Voice page.
* [Bulk Texter Pro](https://www.bulktexterpro.com) supports many features that Bulk Texter Lite does not support, and is also more stable and reliable. If you love Bulk Texter Lite but you wish it could do more, check out [Bulk Texter Pro](https://www.bulktexterpro.com) !

## Some messages aren't sending, but others are. I'm not getting any error messages.
If Bulk Texter Lite worked for you for one or more messages but not for others, it is likely that Google is rate limiting you. 

We can not comment on Google Voice's limits, as they are not published, and Bulk Texter Lite is not affiliated with Google/Google Voice.

You can find tips and best practices in the Bulk Texter Pro [FAQ](https://www.bulktexterpro.com/docs/faq/#what-are-the-recommended-best-practices-for-using-bulk-texter-pro) that may help you avoid being rate limited or blocked by Google:

## Error: "startChat" failed.
Make sure you are on v2.1.4 or higher, as some changes on Google's side necessitated an update to Bulk Texter Lite.

If you are still experiencing this issue, see issue [#149](https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter/issues/149) - this can be caused by incorrectly formatted phone numbers. Double check the phone number that it's failing on.

## Bulk Texter Lite is looping on a single number and failing with an error message.
This is usually caused by Google Voice rolling out website changes in phases. 

First, make sure that you are running the latest version of Bulk Texter Lite by following the [update guide](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/blob/main/README.md#update-it).

If it's still not working on the latest version, Check if there are any [open issues](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/issues) reporting the issue already, and if there are, feel free to subscribe to them or comment on them. 

If there are no issues already reported, open a new one by following the instructions [below](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/blob/main/support.md#support).
