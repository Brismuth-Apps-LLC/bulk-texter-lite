# Google Voice Bulk Texter Support
If you are experiencing issues with Google Voice Bulk Texter, please file an issue here:
https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter/issues/new/choose

If it asks you to create an account, please do so (it's free). I don't allow support requests through the Chrome Web Store because it doesn't notify me when people post there, and when I respond to people it doesn't notify them. I want to be able to actually help people, and that's why I redirect support requests to Github.
