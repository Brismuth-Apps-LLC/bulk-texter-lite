# Bulk Texter Lite - Support

## General Tips
* To stop Bulk Texter Lite at any time, simply close or refresh the Google Voice tab.
* If Bulk Texter Lite is failing to send texts, try sending the same exact message to the same exact recipient manually, without Bulk Texter Lite, and see if that works.
  * If that doesn't work either, then it's likely that Google Voice's algorithm doesn't like the content of the text messages, or they are rate limiting your account. Either way, that would indicate an issue with your Google Voice account, rather than with Bulk Texter Lite.
* If you are unable to send messages manually (without Bulk Texter Lite), then that is an issue with your Google Voice account or the number you're sending to, and is not an issue that Bulk Texter Lite can help with.
* Before proceeding with this guide, make sure that you are running the latest version of Bulk Texter Lite by following the [update guide](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/blob/main/README.md#update-it).
* [Bulk Texter Pro](https://www.bulktexterpro.com) supports many features that Bulk Texter Lite does not support, and is also more stable and reliable. If you love Bulk Texter Lite but you wish it could do more, check out [Bulk Texter Pro](https://www.bulktexterpro.com) !

## Some messages aren't sending, but others are. I'm not getting any error messages.
If Bulk Texter Lite worked for you for one or more messages but not for others, it is likely that Google is rate limiting you. 

Google Voice's limits are not published, and Bulk Texter Lite is not affiliated with Google/Google Voice.

However, you can find tips and best practices in the [Bulk Texter Pro FAQ](https://www.bulktexterpro.com/docs/faq/#what-are-the-recommended-best-practices-for-using-bulk-texter-pro) that may help you avoid being rate limited or blocked by Google.

## Bulk Texter Lite is looping on a single number and failing with an error message.
This is usually caused by Google Voice rolling out website changes in phases. 

First, make sure that you are running the latest version of Bulk Texter Lite by following the [update guide](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/blob/main/README.md#update-it).

If it's still not working on the latest version, Check if there are any [open issues](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/issues) reporting the issue already, and if there are, feel free to subscribe to them or comment on them. 

If there are no issues already reported, open a new one by following the instructions [below](https://github.com/Brismuth-Apps-LLC/bulk-texter-lite/blob/main/support.md#support).
