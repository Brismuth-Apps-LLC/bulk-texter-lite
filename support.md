# Google Voice Bulk Texter Support
### Tips
* To stop the bulk texter at any time, simply refresh the Google Voice tab.
* **Error: "confirmSent" failed:** If the extension was working for you for some messages but stopped suddenly, it is likely that Google has flagged your messages as potential spam, which is against Google's terms of service. Continuing to send messages that appear to be spam could result in your account being deactivated. See these two Google Voice forum threads:
    1. https://support.google.com/voice/forum/AAAAjq5-_rMCpSfMRYCUpc
    2. https://support.google.com/voice/forum/AAAAjq5-_rMM-d-H28-17k
* If you are unable to send a message manually (without the extension), then that is an issue with your Google Voice account or the number you're sending to, and is not an issue that the extension can help with.
* If you are using https://voice.google.com for texting, make sure you haven't enabled texting via Hangouts, as that will disable sending messages via the Google Voice app.

### Support
If you are experiencing issues with Google Voice Bulk Texter and the above tips didn't help you out, please file an issue here:
https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter/issues/new/choose

If it asks you to create an account, please do so (it's free). I don't allow support requests through the Chrome Web Store because it doesn't notify me when people post there, and when I respond to people it doesn't notify them. I want to be able to actually help people, and that's why I redirect support requests to Github.

### Donating 
If you'd like to donate to show your appreciation for this extension, you can do so on PayPal (https://paypal.me/brismuth) or Venmo (@brismuth).

You can also feel free to leave a review in the Chrome Web store:
