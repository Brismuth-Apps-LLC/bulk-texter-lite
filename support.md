# Google Voice Bulk Texter Support

### Tips
* To stop the bulk texter at any time, simply refresh the Google Voice tab.
* **Extension prepares a message but doesn't send it:** As of April 29, Google may be rolling out a breaking update to the Google Voice interface in phases (see [#48](https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter/issues/48)). If you run into this issue, please click the link to [#48](https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter/issues/48) and comment with your situation or subscribe.
* **Error: "confirmSent" failed:** If the extension was working for you for one or more messages but stopped suddenly, it is likely that Google has flagged your messages as potential spam, which is against Google's terms of service. Continuing to send messages that appear to be spam could result in your account being deactivated. 
  * See these two Google Voice forum threads:
    1. https://support.google.com/voice/forum/AAAAjq5-_rMCpSfMRYCUpc
    2. https://support.google.com/voice/forum/AAAAjq5-_rMM-d-H28-17k
  * Google does not publish their algorithm for spam detection. Because of that, I cannot make any guarantees on what will or will not make your messages look like spam.
  * If your messages are not spam but Google thinks they are, it could be because your messages are too long or because they contain a link. Some users have reported that shortening their message or removing links has resolved the issue for them.
  * As mentioned in the above forum threads, this issue will usually clear up after some time passes, although you may need to change the content of the message you're sending as well.
* If you are unable to send a message manually (without the extension), then that is an issue with your Google Voice account or the number you're sending to, and is not an issue that the extension can help with.
* If you are using https://voice.google.com for texting, make sure you haven't enabled texting via Hangouts, as that will disable sending messages via the Google Voice app.

### Support
If you are experiencing issues with Google Voice Bulk Texter and the above tips didn't help you out, please file an issue here:
https://github.com/brismuth/google-voice-bulk-texter/issues/new/choose

If it asks you to create an account, please do so (it's free). I don't allow support requests through the Chrome Web Store because it doesn't notify me when people post there, and when I respond to people it doesn't notify them. I want to be able to actually help people, and that's why I redirect support requests to Github.

### Donating 
If you'd like to donate to show your appreciation for this extension, you can do so on PayPal (https://paypal.me/brismuth) or Venmo (@brismuth).

You can also leave a review in the Chrome Web store:
