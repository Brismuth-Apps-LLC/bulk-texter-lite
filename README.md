# Google Voice Bulk Texter
Send personalized bulk SMS messages from [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com), [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) or [Google Inbox](https://inbox.google.com/).

### What is it?
This is a chrome extension that allows you to write a message once and send it to a list of numbers and names (names are optional). It is a huge time saver if you need to send the same message to a lot of people and you already have a list of phone numbers and names.
