# Google Voice Bulk Texter
A Firefox/Chrome extension that can send personalized bulk SMS messages via [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) or [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/).

It is available as a [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bulk-texter/) or you can follow the [instructions below](#install-it) to install it manually in Chrome.

## What is it? 
This is a chrome extension that allows you to write a message once and send it to a list of numbers and names (names are optional). It is a huge time saver if you need to send the same message to a lot of people and you already have a list of phone numbers and names. It is useful for things like planning events, sending announcements to your church group, or sending reminders to your clients. 


### Site Functionality
| Site  | Bulk message templating  | Automated message sending  |
|---|---|---|

| [hangouts.google.com](https://hangouts.google.com/)  | Yes  | No _(does not actually send the messages, it just prepares them so you can easily review and send them by pressing "Enter")_  |
