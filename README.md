# Google Voice Bulk Texter
Send customized bulk SMS messages via Google Voice from Google Inbox or Hangouts.

### What is it?
This is a chrome extension that allows you to write a message once and send it to a list of numbers and names (names are optional). It is a huge time saver if you need to send the same message to a lot of people and you already have a list of phone numbers and names.

Note that this extension does not actually send the messages, it just prepares them so you can easily send them by pressing "Enter".

### Requirements:
- You must enable Google Voice via Hangouts for this tool to work ([instructions](https://support.google.com/voice/answer/6023920?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en))
- This extension will only work on [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) and [Google Inbox](https://inbox.google.com/).
